# Eastern Ontario Bed Chaser
## About the Program
This program was a school project that I have cleaned up for portfolio
purposes. It was an early attempt to write a GUI interface using Qt Library,
stored data using SQLite and communicating via P2P techniques.  
It was never completed, but the included code is a proof of concept.  

## Installation
To compile, open the project in Qt Creator and run from there.
